Project Title : Exploratory Data Analysis on Medical Insurance Dataset  
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a medical insurance dataset to uncover important patterns, trends, and insights.

Dataset  
The dataset insurance.csv includes features such as:
age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, and charges.

Objectives  
Understand the structure and distribution of the data.  
Visualize relationships between different features, such as smoker status and charges. 
Detect outliers and skewed distributions.  
Analyze how factors like age, BMI, and smoking affect medical charges.

Tools & Technologies  
Python  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  

Key Analysis Performed  
Distribution plots for numerical columns  
Count plots for categorical columns  
Box plots to identify outliers  
Correlation heatmap  
Null value analysis  
Basic data cleaning  

Outcome  
The EDA helps identify which factors most influence medical costs. For instance, smoking status and BMI have a significant effect on charges.
